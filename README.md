# Learning-Naive-and-Forest
My first Data Science Project, few steps towards pandas, feature engineering, visualizations and two ML algorithms: Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

On Jupyter, using Python modules: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn.

## 1. Exploring the data

- Checking missing data. VIS: Heatmap
- Cleaning: dropping and inputing missing data. VIS: bar and boxplot
- Feature engineering: new column based on categorical feature

## 2. Machine Learning
- Train/Test split
- Predictions and evaluation

### 2.1 Random Forest
- Decision tree, ensemble method
### 2.2 Naive Bayes 
- Independece assumption on Bayes theorem
